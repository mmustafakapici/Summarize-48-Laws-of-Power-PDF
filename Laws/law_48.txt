LAW 48
ASSUME FORMLESSNESS
JUDGMENT
By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of
taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move.
Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect
yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting
order. Everything changes.
In martial arts, it is important that strategy be unfathomable, that form be concealed,
and that movements be unexpected, so that preparedness against them be impossible.
What enables a good general to win without fail is always having unfathomable
wisdom and a modus operandi that leaves no tracks. Only the formless cannot be
affected. Sages hide in unfathomability, so their feelings cannot be observed; they
operate in formlessness, so their lines cannot be crossed.
 
THE BOOK OF THE HUAINAN MASTERS, CHINA, SECOND CENTURY B.C.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
By the eighth century B.C., the city-states of Greece had grown so large and prosperous
that they had run out of land to support their expanding populations. So they turned to the
sea, establishing colonies in Asia Minor, Sicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The
city-state of Sparta, however, was landlocked and surrounded by mountains. Lacking
access to the Mediterranean, the Spartans never became a seafaring people; instead they
turned on the cities around them, and, in a series of brutal, violent conflicts lasting more
than a hundred years, managed to conquer an immense area that would provide enough
land for their citizens. This solution to their problem, however, brought a new, more
formidable one: How could they maintain and police their conquered territories? The
subordinate peoples they ruled now outnumbered them ten to one. Surely this horde

would take a horrible revenge on them.
Sparta’s solution was to create a society dedicated to the art of war. Spartans would
be tougher, stronger, and fiercer than their neighbors. This was the only way they could
ensure their stability and survival.
When a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from his mother and
placed in a military club where he was trained to fight and underwent the strictest
discipline. The boys slept on beds of reeds; they were allotted only one outer garment to
wear for an entire year. They studied none of the arts; indeed, the Spartans banned
music, and permitted only slaves to practice the crafts that were necessary to sustain
them. The only skills the Spartans taught were those of warfare. Children seen as
weaklings were left to die in a cavern in the mountains. No system of money or trading
was allowed in Sparta; acquired wealth, they believed, would sow selfishness and
dissension, weakening their warrior discipline. The only way a Spartan could earn a
living was through agriculture, mostly on state-owned lands, which slaves, called
helots, would work for him.
The Spartans’ single-mindedness allowed them to forge the most powerful infantry in
the world. They marched in perfect order and fought with incomparable bravery. Their
tight-knit phalanxes could vanquish an army ten times their size, as they proved in
defeating the Persians at Thermopylae. A Spartan column on the march would strike
terror in the enemy; it seemed to have no weaknesses. Yet although the Spartans proved
themselves mighty warriors, they had no interest in creating an empire. They only
wanted to keep what they had already conquered and to defend it against invaders.
Decades would pass without a single change in the system that had succeeded so well in
preserving Sparta’s status quo.
THE DOC WITH THE CROPPED EARS
“What crime have I committed that I should be thus mutilated by my own master?”
pensively exclaimed Jowler, a young mastiff. “Here’s a pretty condition for a dog of
my pretentions! How can I show my face among my friends? Oh! king of beasts, or
rather their tyrant, who would dare to treat you thus?” His complaints were not
unfounded, for that very morning his master, despite the piercing shrieks of our
young friend, had
 
barbarously cut off his long pendent ears. Jowler expected nothing
less than to give up the ghost. As he advanced in years, he perceived that he gained
more than he had lost by his mutilation; for, being naturally inclined to fight with
others, he would often have returned home with this part disfigured in a hundred
places. A quarrelsome dog always has his ears lacerated. The less we leave others to
lay hold of the better. When one has but one point to defend, it should be protected
for fear of accident. Take for example Master Jowler, who, being armed with a spiked

collar, and having about as much ear as a bird, a wolf would be puzzled to know
where to tackle him.
 
FABLES. JEAN DE LA FOMTAINE, 1621-1695
At the same time that the Spartans were evolving their warlike culture, another city-
state was rising to equal prominence: Athens. Unlike Sparta, Athens had taken to the
sea, not so much to create colonies as for purposes of trade. The Athenians became
great merchants; their currency, the famous “owl coins,” spread throughout the
Mediterranean. Unlike the rigid Spartans, the Athenians responded to every problem
with consummate creativity, adapting to the occasion and creating new social forms and
new arts at an incredible pace. Their society was in constant flux. And as their power
grew, they came to pose a threat to the defense-minded Spartans.
In 431 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and Sparta for so long
finally erupted. It lasted twenty-seven years, but after many twists of fortune, the Spartan
war machine finally emerged victorious. The Spartans now commanded an empire, and
this time they could not stay in their shell. If they gave up what they had gained, the
beaten Athenians would regroup and rise against them, and the long war would have
been fought for naught.
After the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans had been trained in
warfare, not politics or economics; because they were so unaccustomed to it, wealth
and its accompanying ways of life seduced and overwhelmed them. Spartan governors
were sent to rule what had been Athenian lands; far from home, they succumbed to the
worst forms of corruption. Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid Athenian way of
life was slowly breaking down its discipline and loosening its rigid order. And Athens,
meanwhile, was adapting to losing its empire, managing to thrive as a cultural and
economic center.
Confused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and weaker. Some thirty
years after defeating Athens, it lost an important battle with the city-state of Thebes.
Almost overnight, this once mighty nation collapsed, never to recover.
Interpretation
In the evolution of species, protective armor has almost always spelled disaster.
Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most often becomes a dead end for the
animal encased in it; it slows the creature down, making it hard for it to forage for food
and making it a target for fast-moving predators. Animals that take to the sea or sky, and
that move swiftly and unpredictably, are infinitely more powerful and secure.
In facing a serious problem—controlling superior numbers—Sparta reacted like an

animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the environment. But like a turtle, the
Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They managed to preserve stability for three
hundred years, but at what cost? They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve
the tension, a constant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea,
learning to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed themselves in
their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govern, which they did not want;
defeat would mean the end of their military machine, which they did not want, either.
Only stasis allowed them to survive. But nothing in the world can remain stable forever,
and the shell or system you evolve for your protection will someday prove your
undoing.
In the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated it, but the Athenian
money. Money flows everywhere it has the opportunity to go; it cannot be controlled, or
made to fit a prescribed pattern. It is inherently chaotic. And in the long run, money
made Athens the conqueror, by infiltrating the Spartan system and corroding its
protective armor. In the battle between the two systems, Athens was fluid and creative
enough to take new forms, while Sparta could grow only more rigid until it cracked.
This is the way the world works, whether for animals, cultures, or individuals. In the
face of the world’s harshness and danger, organisms of any kind develop protection—a
coat of armor, a rigid system, a comforting ritual. For the short term it may work, but for
the long term it spells disaster. People weighed down by a system and inflexible ways
of doing things cannot move fast, cannot sense or adapt to change. They lumber around
more and more slowly until they go the way of the brontosaurus. Learn to move fast and
adapt or you will be eaten.
The best way to avoid this fate is to assume formlessness. No predator alive can
attack what it cannot see.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When World War II ended and the Japanese, who had invaded China in 1937, had
finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists, lead by Chiang Kai-shek, decided the
time had come to annihilate the Chinese Communists, their hated rivals, once and for all.
They had almost succeeded in 1935, forcing the Communists into the Long March, the
grueling retreat that had greatly diminished their numbers. Although the Communists had
recovered somewhat during the war against Japan, it would not be difficult to defeat
them now. They controlled only isolated areas in the countryside, had unsophisticated
weaponry, lacked any military experience or training beyond mountain fighting, and

controlled no important parts of China, except areas of Manchuria, which they had
managed to take after the Japanese retreat. Chiang decided to commit his best forces in
Manchuria. He would take over its major cities and from those bases would spread
through this northern industrial region, sweeping the Communists away. Once
Manchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse.
In 1945 and ’46 the plan worked perfectly: The Nationalists easily took the major
Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of this critical campaign, the
Communist strategy made no sense. When the Nationalists began their push, the
Communists dispersed to Manchuria’s most out-of-the-way comers. Their small units
harassed the Nationalist armies, ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but
these dispersed units never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a
town only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards nor vanguards,
they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive and formless.
One seductive and ultimately always fatal path has been the development of
protective armor. An organism can protect itself by concealment, by swiftness in
flight, by effective counterattack, by uniting for attack and defense with other
individuals of its species and also by encasing itself within bony plates and spines....
Almost always the experiment of armor failed. Creatures adopiing it tended to
become unwieldy. They had to move relatively slowly. Hence they were forced to live
mainly on vegetable food; and thus in general they were at a disadvantage as
compared with foes living on more rapidly “profitable” animal food: The repeated
failure of protective armor shows that, even at a somewhat low evolutionary level,
mind triumphed over mere matter. It is this sort of triumph which has been supremely
exemplified in Man.
SCIENI IFIC THEORY AND RELIGION, E. W. BARNES, 1933
The Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in the face of superior forces
and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse-tung, the Communist leader, was more a poet and
philosopher than a general, whereas Chiang had studied warfare in the West and was a
follower of the German military writer Carl von Clausewitz, among others.
Yet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao’s attacks. After the Nationalists had taken
the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy what was generally considered
Manchuria’s useless space, the Communists started using that large space to surround
the cities. If Chiang sent an army from one city to reinforce another, the Communists
would encircle the rescuing army. Chiang’s forces were slowly broken into smaller and
smaller units, isolated from one another, their lines of supply and communication cut.
The Nationalists still had superior firepower, but if they could not move, what good
was it?
A kind of terror overcame the Nationalist soldiers. Commanders comfortably remote

from the front lines might laugh at Mao, but the soldiers had fought the Communists in
the mountains, and had come to fear their elusiveness. Now these soldiers sat in their
cities and watched as their fast-moving enemies, as fluid as water, poured in on them
from all sides. There seemed to be millions of them. The Communists also encircled the
soldiers’ spirits, bombarding them with propaganda to lower their morale and pressure
them to desert.
The Nationalists began to surrender in their minds. Their encircled and isolated cities
started collapsing even before being directly attacked; one after another fell in quick
succession. In November of 1948, the Nationalists surrendered Manchuria to the
Communists—a humiliating blow to the technically superior Nationalist army, and one
that proved decisive in the war. By the following year the Communists controlled all of
China.
Interpretation
The two board games that best approximate the strategies of war are chess and the
Asian game of go. In chess the board is small. In comparison to go, the attack comes
relatively quickly, forcing a decisive battle. It rarely pays to withdraw, or to sacrifice
your pieces, which must be concentrated at key areas. Go is much less formal. It is
played on a large grid, with 361 intersections—nearly six times as many positions as in
chess. Black and white stones (one color for each side) are placed on the board’s
intersections, one at a time, wherever you like. Once all your stones (52 for each side)
are on the board, the object is to isolate the stones of your opponent by encircling them.
The sage neither seeks to follow the ways of the ancients nor estahlishes any fixed
standard for all times but examines the things of his age and then prepares to deal
with them. There was in Sung a man, who tilled a field in which there stood the trunk
of a tree. Once a hare, while running fast, rushed against the trunk, broke its neck,
and died. Thereupon the man cast his plough aside and watched that tree, hoping that
he would get another hare. Yet he never caught another hare and was himself
ridiculed by the people of Sung. Now supposing somebody wanted to govern the
people of the present age with the policies of the early kings, he would be doing
exactly the same thing as that man who watched the tree.
 
HAN-FEI-TZU, CHINESE PHILOSOPHFR, THIRD CENTURY B.C.
A game of go—called 
wei-chi
 in China—can last up to three hundred moves. The
strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly; the more complex the
pattern your stones initially create on the board, the harder it is for your opponent to

understand your strategy. Fighting to control a particular area is not worth the trouble:
You have to think in larger terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually
to dominate the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility.
With mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encircle them. The
aim is not to kill off the opponent’s pieces directly, as in chess, but to induce a kind of
paralysis and collapse. Chess is linear, position oriented, and aggressive; go is
nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indirect until the end of the game, when the winner
can surround the opponent’s stones at an accelerated pace.
Chinese military strategists have been influenced by go for centuries. Its proverbs
have been applied to war time and again; Mao Tse-tung was an addict of 
wei-chi,
 and
its precepts were ingrained in his strategies. A key 
wei-chi
 concept, for example, is to
use the size of the board to your advantage, spreading out in every direction so that your
opponent cannot fathom your movements in a simple linear way.
“Every Chinese,” Mao once wrote, “should consciously throw himself into this war
of a jigsaw pattern” against the Nationalists. Place your men in a jigsaw pattern in go,
and your opponent loses himself trying to figure out what you are up to. Either he wastes
time pursuing you or, like Chiang Kai-shek, he assumes you are incompetent and fails to
protect himself. And if he concentrates on single areas, as Western strategy advises, he
becomes a sitting duck for encirclement. In the 
wei-chi
 way of war, you encircle the
enemy’s brain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to confuse and
dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communists—an apparent formlessness that
disoriented and terrified their enemy.
Where chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer to the kind of
strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles are fought indirectly, in vast,
loosely connected areas. Its strategies are abstract and multidimensional, inhabiting a
plane beyond time and space: the strategist’s mind. In this fluid form of warfare, you
value movement over position. Your speed and mobility make it impossible to predict
your moves; unable to understand you, your enemy can form no strategy to defeat you.
Instead of fixing on particular spots, this indirect form of warfare spreads out, just as
you can use the large and disconnected nature of the real world to your advantage. Be
like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything solid to attack; watch as they exhaust
themselves pursuing you, trying to cope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness
allows you to truly surprise your enemies—by the time they figure out where you are
and what you are up to, it is too late.
When you want to fight us, we don’t let you and you can’t find us. But when
 
we want to fight you, we make sure that you can’t get away and we hit you
 
squarely ... and wipe you out.... The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy
 
camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.

Mao Tse-tung, 1893-1976
General Rommel surpassed Patton as a creative intellect.... Rommel shunned military
formalism. He made no fixed plans beyond those intended for the initial clash;
thereafter, he tailored his tactics to meet specific situations as they arose. He was a
lightning-fast decision-maker, physically maintaining a pace that matched his active
mentality. In a forbidding sea of sand, he operated in a free environment. Once
Rommel ruptured the British lines in Africa, he had the whole northern part of the
continent opened to him. Comparatively free from the hamstringing authority of
Berlin, disregarding orders even from Hitler himself on occasion, Rommel
implemented one successful operation after another until he had most of North Africa
under his control and Cairo trembling at his feet.
THE ART OF WINNING WARS, JAMES MRAZEK, 1968
KEYS TO POWER
The human animal is distinguished by its constant creation of forms. Rarely expressing
its emotions directly, it gives them form through language, or through socially
acceptable rituals. We cannot communicate our emotions without a form.
The forms that we create, however, change constantly—in fashion, in style, in all
those human phenomena representing the mood of the moment. We are constantly
altering the forms we have inherited from previous generations, and these changes are
signs of life and vitality. Indeed, the things that don’t change, the forms that rigidify,
come to look to us like death, and we destroy them. The young show this most clearly:
Uncomfortable with the forms that society imposes upon them, having no set identity,
they play with their own characters, trying on a variety of masks and poses to express
themselves. This is the vitality that drives the motor of form, creating constant changes
in style.
The powerful are often people who in their youth have shown immense creativity in
expressing something new through a new form. Society grants them power because it
hungers for and rewards this sort of newness. The problem comes later, when they often
grow conservative and possessive. They no longer dream of creating new forms; their
identities are set, their habits congeal, and their rigidity makes them easy targets.
Everyone knows their next move. Instead of demanding respect they elicit boredom: Get
off the stage! we say, let someone else, someone younger, entertain us. When locked in
the past, the powerful look comical—they are overripe fruit, waiting to fall from the
tree.

Power can only thrive if it is flexible in its forms. To be formless is not to be
amorphous; everything has a form—it is impossible to avoid. The formlessness of
power is more like that of water, or mercury, taking the form of whatever is around it.
Changing constantly, it is never predictable. The powerful are constantly creating form,
and their power comes from the rapidity with which they can change. Their
formlessness is in the eye of the enemy who cannot see what they are up to and so has
nothing solid to attack. This is the premier pose of power: ungraspable, as elusive and
swift as the god Mercury, who could take any form he pleased and used this ability to
wreak havoc on Mount Olympus.
Human creations evolve toward abstraction, toward being more mental and less
material. This evolution is clear in art, which, in this century, made the great discovery
of abstraction and conceptualism; it can also be seen in politics, which over time have
become less overtly violent, more complicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare and
strategy too have followed this pattern. Strategy began in the manipulation of armies on
land, positioning them in ordered formations; on land, strategy is relatively two
dimensional, and controlled by topography. But all the great powers have eventually
taken to the sea, for commerce and colonization. And to protect their trading lanes they
have had to learn how to fight at sea. Maritime warfare requires tremendous creativity
and abstract thinking, since the lines are constantly shifting. Naval captains distinguish
themselves by their ability to adapt to the literal fluidity of the terrain and to confuse the
enemy with an abstract, hard-to-anticipate form. They are operating in a third
dimension: the mind.
CHARACTER ARMOR
To carry out the instinctual inhibition demanded by the modern world and to be able
to cope with the energy stasis which results from this inhibition, the ego has to
undergo a change. The ego, i.e., that part of the person that is exposed to danger,
becomes rigid, as we say, when it is continually subjected to the same or similar
conflicts between need and a fear-inducing outer world. It acquires in this process a
chronic, automatically functioning mode of reaction, i.e., its “character.” It is as if
the affective personality armored itself, as if the hard shell it develops were intended
to deflect and weaken the blows of the outer world as well as the clamoring of the
inner needs. This armoring makes the person less sensitive to unpleasure, but also
restricts his libidinal and aggressive motility and thus reduces his capacity for
achievement and pleasure. We say the ego has become less flexible and more rigid,
and that the abiliry to regulate the energy economy depends on the extent of the
armoring.
WILHELM REICH, 1897-1957

Back on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution toward abstraction.
T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modern strategist to develop the theory behind this
kind of warfare, and to put it into practice. His ideas influenced Mao, who found in his
writings an uncanny Western equivalent to 
wei-chi.
 Lawrence was working with Arabs
fighting for their territory against the Turks. His idea was to make the Arabs blend into
the vast desert, never providing a target, never collecting together in one place. As the
Turks scrambled to fight this vaporous army, they spread themselves thin, wasting
energy in moving from place to place. They had the superior firepower but the Arabs
kept the initiative by playing cat and mouse, giving the Turks nothing to hold on to,
destroying their morale. “Most wars were wars of contact.... Ours should be a war of
detachment,” Lawrence wrote. “We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a
vast unknown desert, not disclosing ourselves till we attacked.”
This is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has become far too
dangerous and costly; indirection and elusiveness yield far better results at a much
lower cost. The main cost, in fact, is mental—the thinking it takes to align your forces in
scattered patterns, and to undermine the minds and psychology of your opponents. And
nothing will infuriate and disorient them more than formlessness. In a world where wars
of detachment are the order of the day, formlessness is crucial.
The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to take
nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness. When you act defensive, you show
your emotions, revealing a clear form. Your opponents will realize they have hit a
nerve, an Achilles’ heel. And they will hit it again and again. So train yourself to take
nothing personally. Never let anyone get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that
cannot be held: Let no one know what gets to you, or where your weaknesses lie. Make
your face a formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming colleagues
and opponents.
One man who used this technique was Baron James Rothschild. A German Jew in
Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Rothschild never took any attack
on him personally or showed he had been hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted
himself to the political climate, whatever it was—the stiffly formal Restoration
monarchy of Louis XVIII, the bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, the democratic
revolution of 1848, the upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in 1852. Rothschild
accepted them one and all, and blended in. He could afford to appear hypocritical or
opportunistic because he was valued for his money, not his politics; his money was the
currency of power. While he adapted and thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all
the other great families that had begun the century immensely wealthy were ruined in the
period’s complicated shifts and turns of fortune. Attaching themselves to the past, they
revealed their embrace of a form.

Throughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most adeptly practiced by
the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically different position from a king;
because she is a woman, her subjects and courtiers are likely to doubt her ability to
rule, her strength of character. If she favors one side in some ideological struggle, she is
said to be acting out of emotional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and
plays the authoritarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by
nature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of governing that in
the end often proves more powerful than the more direct, male form.
Two female leaders exemplifying the formless style of rule are Queen Elizabeth of
England and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. In the violent wars between
Catholics and Protestants, Elizabeth steered a middle course. She avoided alliances that
would commit her to one side, and that over time would harm the country. She managed
to keep her country at peace until it was strong enough for war. Her reign was one of the
most glorious in history because of her incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible
ideology.
Catherine the Great too evolved an improvisatory style of governing. After she
deposed her husband, Emperor Peter II, taking sole control of Russia in 1762, no one
thought she would survive. But she had no preconceived ideas, no philosophy or theory
to dictate her policies. Although a foreigner (she came from Germany), she understood
Russia’s moods, and how it was changing over the years. “One must govern in such a
way that one’s people think they themselves want to do what one commands them to
do,” she said, and to do this she had to be always a step ahead of their desires and to
adapt to their resistance. By never forcing the issue, she reformed Russia in a strikingly
short period of time.
This feminine, formless style of ruling may have emerged as a way of prospering
under difficult circumstances, but it has proved immensely seductive to those who have
served under it. Being fluid, it is relatively easy for its subjects to obey, for they feel
less coerced, less bent to their ruler’s ideology. It also opens up options where an
adherence to a doctrine closes them off. Without committing to one side, it allows the
ruler to play one enemy off another. Rigid rulers may seem strong, but with time their
inflexibility wears on the nerves, and their subjects find ways to push them from the
stage. Flexible, formless rulers will be much criticized, but they will endure, and
people will eventually come to identify with them, since they are as their subjects are—
changing with the wind, open to circumstance.
Despite upsets and delays, the permeable style of power generally triumphs in the
end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta through its money and its culture.
When you find yourself in conflict with someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a
momentary victory. Seem to bow to their superiority. Then, by being formless and

adaptable, slowly insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off
guard, for rigid people are always ready to ward off direct blows but are helpless
against the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must play the
chameleon—conform on the surface, while breaking down your enemy from the inside.
For centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously, and appeared
susceptible to foreign cultures and influences. Joao Rodriguez, a Portuguese priest who
arrived in Japan in 1577 and lived there for many years, wrote, “I am flabbergasted by
the Japanese willingness to try and accept everything Portuguese.” He saw Japanese in
the streets wearing Portuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their necks and crosses at
their hips. This might seem like a weak, mutable culture, but Japan’s adaptability
actually protected the country from having an alien culture imposed by military
invasion. It seduced the Portuguese and other Westerners into believing the Japanese
were yielding to a superior culture when actually the foreign culture’s ways were
merely a fashion to be donned and doffed. Under the surface, Japanese culture thrived.
Had the Japanese been rigid about foreign influences and tried to fight them off, they
might have suffered the injuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of
formlessness—it gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit.
In evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinction. What is immense and
bloated has no mobility, but must constantly feed itself. The unintelligent are often
seduced into believing that size connotes power, the bigger the better.
In 483 B.C., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he could conquer the
country in one easy campaign. After all, he had the largest army ever assembled for one
invasion—the historian Herodotus estimated it at over more than five million. The
Persians planned to build a bridge across the Hellespont to overrun Greece from the
land, while their equally immense navy would pin the Greek ships in harbor, preventing
their forces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet as Xerxes prepared the
invasion, his adviser Artabanus warned his master of grave misgivings: “The two
mightiest powers in the world are against you,” he said. Xerxes laughed—what powers
could match his gigantic army? “I will tell you what they are,” answered Artabanus.
“The land and the sea.” There were no safe harbors large enough to receive Xerxes’
fleet. And the more land the Persians conquered, and the longer their supply lines
stretched, the more ruinous the cost of feeding this immense army would prove.
Thinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the invasion. Yet as
Artabanus predicted, bad weather at sea decimated the Persian fleet, which was too
large to take shelter in any harbor. On land, meanwhile, the Persian army destroyed
everything in its path, which only made it impossible to feed, since the destruction
included crops and stores of food. It was also an easy and slow-moving target. The
Greeks practiced all kinds of deceptive maneuvers to disorient the Persians. Xerxes’

eventual defeat at the hands of the Greek allies was an immense disaster. The story is
emblematic of all those who sacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot
will almost always win, for they have more strategic options. The more gigantic the
enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse.
The need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we grow more likely
to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form. We become predictable, always
the first sign of decrepitude. And predictability makes us appear comical. Although
ridicule and disdain might seem mild forms of attack, they are actually potent weapons,
and will eventually erode a foundation of power. An enemy who does not respect you
will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest animal dangerous.
The late-eighteenth-century court of France, as exemplified by Marie-Antoinette, had
become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality that the average Frenchman thought it a
silly relic. This depreciation of a centuries-old institution was the first sign of a
terminal disease, for it represented a symbolic loosening of the people’s ties to
monarchy. As the situation worsened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew only
more rigid in their adherence to the past—and quickened their path to the guillotine.
King Charles I of England reacted similarly to the tide of democratic change brewing in
England in the 1630s: He disbanded Parliament, and his court rituals grew increasingly
formal and distant. He wanted to return to an older style of ruling, with adherence to all
kinds of petty protocol. His rigidity only heightened the desire for change. Soon, of
course, he was swept up in a devastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to
the executioner’s axe.
As you get older, you must rely even less on the past. Be vigilant lest the form your
character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter of mimicking the fashions
of youth—that is equally worthy of laughter. Rather your mind must constantly adapt to
each circumstance, even the inevitable change that the time has come to move over and
let those of younger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you look
uncannily like a cadaver.
Never forget, though, that formlessness is a strategic pose. It gives you room to create
tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your next move, they reveal their
own strategy, putting them at a decided disadvantage. It keeps the initiative on your side,
putting your enemies in the position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils their
spying and intelligence. Remember: Formlessness is a tool. Never confuse it with a go-
with-the-flow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You use
formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but because it will
increase your power.
Finally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing events through your
own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people constantly peddle your way. It

means that ultimately you must throw out the laws that others preach, and the books they
write to tell you what to do, and the sage advice of the elder. “The laws that govern
circumstances are abolished by new circumstances,” Napoleon wrote, which means that
it is up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people’s ideas and
you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much respect for other people’s
wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be brutal with the past, especially your
own, and have no respect for the philosophies that are foisted on you from outside.
Image: Mercury. The winged messenger, 
god of commerce, patron saint of thieves, 
gamblers, and all those who deceive through 
swiftness. The day Mercury was born he invented 
the lyre; by that evening he had stolen the cattle of 
Apollo. He would scour the world, assuming 
whatever form he desired. Like the liquid metal 
named after him, he embodies the elusive, 
the ungraspable—the power of formlessness.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Authority: Therefore the consummation of forming an army is to arrive at formlessness.
Victory in war is not repetitious, but adapts its form endlessly.... A military force has no
constant formation, water has no constant shape: The ability to gain victory by changing
and adapting according to the opponent is called genius. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.)
REVERSAL
Using space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not mean forsaking the
concentration of your power when it is valuable to you. Formlessness makes your
enemies hunt all over for you, scattering their own forces, mental as well as physical.
When you finally engage them, though, hit them with a powerful, concentrated blow.
That is how Mao succeeded against the Nationalists: He broke their forces into small,

isolated units, which he then could easily overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of
concentration prevailed.
When you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and keep your long-
term strategy in mind. When you assume a form and go on the attack, use concentration,
speed, and power. As Mao said, 
“When
 we fight you, we make sure you can’t get
away.”
